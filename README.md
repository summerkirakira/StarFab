# StarCitizen Data Viewer - SCDV

A UI on top of `scdatatools`.

### NOTE: scdv is considered pre-alpha. It's more of a proof of concept than a fully functional tool

If you have any problems or suggestions, create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/tools/scdv/-/issues/new)!

## Optional Dependencies

### View and Convert textures (dds)
