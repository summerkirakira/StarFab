# StarCitizen Data Viewer - SCDV

A GUI built on top of [scdatatools](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/frameworks/scdatatools).

### NOTE: scdv is considered pre-alpha. It's more of a proof of concept than a fully functional tool

If you have any problems or suggestions, create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/tools/scdv/-/issues/new)!

# Installation

## Optional Dependencies

### View and Convert textures (dds)

To view or convert textures (.dds*) files, SCDV relies on [texconv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases) or [compressonator](https://gpuopen.com/compressonator/). Ensure that `texconv` or `compressonatorcli` is installed and in your system `PATH`.

### Convert Audio Files (wem)

To convert wem files, you must have [ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg) and [revorb](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmVgjfU7qgPEtANatrfh7VQJby9t1ojrTbN7X8Ei4djF4e/revorb.exe) in your path. **Both are included in the MSI installer for Windows.**

> **Note for Windows: you must have the Vorbis codecs installed to listen to audio in SCDV. You can download them on [Xiph.org](https://xiph.org/dshow/downloads/)**
